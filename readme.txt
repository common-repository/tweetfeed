== Changelog ==

= 1.3.1 =
* updated libs to Scriptaculous 1.8.3 for fixing some little bugs

= 1.3 =
* added a random seed setting. This way the widget will download more tweets in the background, shuffle them and still only display the count of tweets you've set. Good for displaying a shuffled friends timeline ;-)

= 1.2 =
* added refresh timer
* now showing RT's in friends timeline too

= 1.1 =
* basically added the option to show the 'friends_timeline' instead. You will need some OAuth single tokens for this by registering your webpage as a twitter app through http://dev.twitter.com/apps

= 1.0 =
* initial release
